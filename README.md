## 🎶 About Strudel

[Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) is a JavaScript-based live coding environment inspired by TidalCycles. It runs in the browser and allows expressive, pattern-based music creation.

This repository is meant to:
- Archive finished songs
- Store works-in-progress
- Reuse samples across compositions

---

## 🎧 Usage

1. Open **Strudel** in your browser.
2. Load or copy a song from the `Songs/` folder.
3. Make sure the samples referenced by the song are available (locally or uploaded to Strudel if needed).
4. Modify, remix, and perform.


## 📌 Notes

- This is a personal creative repository; structure may evolve over time.
- Some songs may be unfinished or experimental.
